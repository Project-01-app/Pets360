 What Was Implemented
This app was built from scratch and includes:

Layout Design: Custom XML layouts were created for each screen, including the main list, pet registration form, detail view, and photo preview. Each layout was designed to ensure clarity, responsiveness, and usability.

String Management: All user-facing text was defined in strings.xml to support localization and maintain consistency across the app.

CRUD Functionality: Users can create, view, update, and delete pet records using Room Database for local persistence.

Search Feature: A dynamic search bar filters pets by name in real time.

Multimedia Integration: Users can take photos with the camera or select images from the gallery to associate with each pet.

Navigation Component: Seamless transitions between fragments were implemented using Android’s Navigation architecture.

Dialog Confirmations: Sensitive actions like deletions are confirmed through alert dialogs to prevent accidental loss.

Modular Code Structure: The app follows a clean architecture with separate packages for data, UI, and logic.

Documentation and Version Control: Weekly progress was tracked via Git commits and Pull Requests, with clear documentation of each feature.
